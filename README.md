# the human model project

## Why

To understand your self you must understand:

1. the `body` (diet, exercise, anatomy, medicine, ...)
2. the `mind` (physchology, neurology, creativity, ...)

Becuase you have a self, you have a right to:

1. all information about the self
2. posessed by any credible source that wants to share it (1)
3. forever, free and anonymously

## Goals

- Create the most acurate model of self ever created
- Maximize utility to as many people as possible
- Make available to as many people as possible

## Status

stay tuned
